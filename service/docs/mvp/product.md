## üí° 3. Value Proposition

## üî® 4. MVP Hypothesis

> A chatbot-style interface that asks a few key questions (budget, schedule, education goal) and returns a curated shortlist of schools based on College Scorecard data and fuzzy matching.

If learners complete this flow and feel clearer within 5 minutes, we‚Äôre on the right track.
